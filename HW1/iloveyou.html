                The ILOVEYOU virus happened on May 4, 2000, and it originated in the Philippines. This is one of the 
                most widespread and harmful viruses in history, so much so that it led to global awareness of the 
                importance of strong cybersecurity practices. It was estimated to have caused between 
                $3 - $15 billion in damages.

                In just the matter of a few hours, the ILOVEYOU virus was able to spread from Asia, to Europe, and the Americas. 
                Many important organizations and companies were affected, such as the CIA, FBI, the Federal Reserve and AT&T. 
                Due to the massive influx of emails, many mail servers also crashed.

                This virus was able to run whenever the computer restarted to ensure it could carry out its other objectives. 
                These were to replicate and send itself to anyone on the user's address book, and to install a trojan that would attempt 
                to steal any passwords from the computer.

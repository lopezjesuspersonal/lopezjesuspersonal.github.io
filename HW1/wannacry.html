                WannaCry was a powerful hybrid between ransomware and worm. Not only did it spread to 
                any open networks it was able to connect to, but it encrypted data on any machine it latched 
                onto and locked it behind a crypto paywall. This exploit was developed by the NSA, however it was 
                stolen and then used by a group named the Shadow Brokers.

                The Shadow Brokers are attackers that use many types of zero-days and malware tools, many of 
                which have been developed by the NSA. It is suspected that the leak was due to an insider attack.

                Funnily enough, this exploit was one of the simplest to patch due to an oversight in the code. 
                A security researcher named Marcus Hutchins was able to reverse engineer the source code and found 
                that the virus would automatically disable itself if it believed itself to be in a virtual machine.

                The Creeper program was the first virus ever created, developed by Bob Thomas 
                in 1971. Although not really malicious, it was able to self-replicate and spread 
                itself across a network.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's only real purpose was to prove it was possible to make a program that could 
                move across a network to infect other machines. It didn't do much besides display 
                the message: "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!"
            </p>
            <p>
                To defend against the Creeper virus, the first antivirus was developed. The creator 
                of the Reaper antivirus is believed to be Ray Tomlinson, the creator of e-mail. The 
                Reaper's only purpose was to detect the Creeper, and immediately remove it from the 
                system to stop it from spreading to another computer.
